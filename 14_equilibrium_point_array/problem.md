# Equilibium point of an Array

- The function accepts an integer array 'arr' of size 'n' as its argument. The function needs to return the index of an equilibrium point in the array, where sum of elements on the left is equal to the sum of elements on the right of the index. If no equilibrium point exists return -1.

- INPUT1:
7
-7 1 5 2 -4 3 0

OUUTPUT1:
3

* Explaination:
3 is an equilibrium index, because: arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] = arr[4] + arr[5] + arr[6]

- INPUT
3
1 2 3

- OUTPUT
-1

Explaination: There is no equilibrium index in the array.
