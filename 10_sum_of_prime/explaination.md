This program computes the **sum of all prime numbers** less than or equal to a given integer \( n \). Below is a detailed explanation of the code.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Prime Number**:
   - A number greater than 1 is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - For example:
     - Primes: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots\)
     - Non-primes: \(4, 6, 8, 9, \dots\) (as they are divisible by numbers other than 1 and themselves).

2. **Task**:
   - Input: An integer \( n \).
   - Output: Sum of all prime numbers from \(2\) to \(n\).

---

### **Code Walkthrough**

#### 1. **Include Header Files**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` includes all necessary standard libraries, such as:
  - `iostream`: For input/output operations.
  - `cmath`: For mathematical functions like `sqrt`.

---

#### 2. **Define the Function `primeNum`**
This function calculates the sum of all primes less than or equal to \( n \).

**Signature**:
```cpp
int primeNum(int n);
```
- **Input**: An integer \( n \).
- **Output**: The sum of all prime numbers from \( 2 \) to \( n \).

---

#### **Step-by-Step Execution of `primeNum`**

##### **1. Handle Base Cases**
```cpp
if(n == 0 or n == 1) return 0;
```
- If \( n \) is \( 0 \) or \( 1 \), return \( 0 \) because there are no primes less than or equal to \( n \).

---

##### **2. Initialize Variables**
```cpp
int sum = 0;
```
- `sum`: Used to accumulate the sum of prime numbers.

---

##### **3. Loop Through Numbers From \( 2 \) to \( n \)**
```cpp
for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    bool isprime = true;
```
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates through each number \( i \) from \( 2 \) to \( n \) (since \( 2 \) is the smallest prime).
- `isprime`: A boolean variable to check whether the current number \( i \) is prime. Initially set to `true`.

---

##### **4. Check If \( i \) is Prime**
```cpp
for(int j = 2; j <= sqrt(i); j++) {
    if(i % j == 0) {
        isprime = false;
        break;
    }
}
```
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates through numbers \( j \) from \( 2 \) to \( \sqrt{i} \):
  - If \( i \) is divisible by \( j \), it means \( i \) is not a prime number. Set `isprime` to `false` and exit the loop using `break`.

**Why only up to \( \sqrt{i} \)?**
- If \( i \) is divisible by a number greater than \( \sqrt{i} \), the corresponding factor would have already been found below \( \sqrt{i} \).
  - For example, to check if \( 36 \) is prime, you only need to check divisors up to \( \sqrt{36} = 6 \).

---

##### **5. Add Primes to the Sum**
```cpp
if(isprime) sum += i;
```
- If \( isprime \) is `true` (i.e., \( i \) is a prime number), add \( i \) to `sum`.

---

##### **6. Return the Result**
```cpp
return sum;
```
- Return the final sum of all prime numbers.

---

#### 3. **Main Function**
```cpp
int main() {
    int result; cin >> result;
    cout << primeNum(result) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
- The `main` function does the following:
  1. Reads an integer input \( n \) from the user (`cin >> result`).
  2. Calls the `primeNum` function with \( n \).
  3. Outputs the result to the console.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:
```
10
```

#### Execution:
1. Call `primeNum(10)`:
   - Initialize `sum = 0`.
   - Iterate through numbers \( 2 \) to \( 10 \).

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:
- \( i = 2 \): Prime → `sum = 2`.
- \( i = 3 \): Prime → `sum = 2 + 3 = 5`.
- \( i = 4 \): Not prime (divisible by \( 2 \)) → `sum = 5`.
- \( i = 5 \): Prime → `sum = 5 + 5 = 10`.
- \( i = 6 \): Not prime (divisible by \( 2 \)) → `sum = 10`.
- \( i = 7 \): Prime → `sum = 10 + 7 = 17`.
- \( i = 8 \): Not prime (divisible by \( 2 \)) → `sum = 17`.
- \( i = 9 \): Not prime (divisible by \( 3 \)) → `sum = 17`.
- \( i = 10 \): Not prime (divisible by \( 2 \)) → `sum = 17`.

**Output**:
```
17
```

---

### **Complexity Analysis**
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Outer loop runs \( n-1 \) iterations (\( 2 \) to \( n \)).
   - Inner loop runs approximately \( \sqrt{k} \) iterations for each number \( k \).
   - Overall: \( O(n \sqrt{n}) \).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Only a few variables (`sum`, `isprime`) are used.
   - Overall: \( O(1) \).

---

### **Key Improvements**
- To improve efficiency, you could use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to precompute all primes up to \( n \), reducing the time complexity to \( O(n \log \log n) \).
