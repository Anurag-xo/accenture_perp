# Array difference

- You are given a function.

int findCount(int arr[], int length, int Num, int diff);
- The function accepts an integre array 'arr', its length and two integer variables 'num' and 'diff'.

- Implement this function to find and return the number of elements of 'arr' having an absolute difference of less than or equal to 'diff' with 'num'.

- Note:
IN case there is no element in 'arr' whose absolute difference with 'num' is less than or equal to 'diff', return -1.

- Example:
INPUT:
arr: 1 2 3 14 56 77 13
num: 13
diff: 2

OUTPUT:
3

- Explaintaion.
Elements of 'arr' having absolute difference of less than or equal to 'diff' i.e. 2 with 'num' i.e. 13 are 12, 13 and 14.
