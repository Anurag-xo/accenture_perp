This code takes a positive integer `n` as input and rearranges its binary bits to form the smallest possible integer with the same number of set bits (1s) in consecutive order. Letâ€™s go through it step-by-step.

### Code Breakdown

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
```

- The code begins by including the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header, which is a shorthand to include all standard libraries.
- An integer `n` is declared, and the program reads an integer value from the user as input.

### Step 1: Counting the Set Bits (1s)

```cpp
    int count = 0;
        
    // Count the number of set bits in N
    while(n > 0) {
        if (n & 1) {              // Check if the least significant bit is set
            count++;
        }
        n = n >> 1;               // Right shift n by 1 to check the next bit
    }
```

- `count` is initialized to `0`. This variable will keep track of the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`.
- The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
  - Inside the loop, `n & 1` is used to check if the least significant bit of `n` is 1:
    - If `n & 1` is true, it means the least significant bit is set, so `count` is incremented.
  - `n` is then right-shifted by 1 (`n = n >> 1`), moving the next bit to the least significant position for the next iteration.
- This loop effectively counts the total number of 1s in the binary representation of `n` and stores it in `count`.

**Example**:
- For `n = 10` (binary `1010`), the `count` will end up as `2` because there are two 1s.

### Step 2: Constructing the Minimum Possible Number with `count` Set Bits

```cpp
    // 2 set bits = 2^0*1 + 2^1*1 = 3
    int ans = 0;
    int power = 1;

    for(int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        ans += power * 1;
        power = power * 2;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

- `ans` is initialized to `0`. This variable will hold the result (the smallest number with `count` consecutive set bits).
- `power` is initialized to `1`, representing \(2^0\). This variable will be doubled in each iteration to represent powers of 2.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop runs `count` times. Each iteration of the loop sets the next bit in `ans` to 1, starting from the least significant bit.
  - `ans += power * 1;` adds the current `power` value to `ans`, effectively setting a new bit in `ans`.
  - `power = power * 2;` updates `power` to the next power of 2 (doubles `power`) for the next bit position.

- This loop constructs the smallest integer with `count` consecutive 1s in binary representation.

**Example**:
- If `count` is `2` (indicating two 1s), the loop will do the following:
  - First iteration: `ans = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`, `power = 1 * 2 = 2`
  - Second iteration: `ans = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3`, `power = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - After two iterations, `ans = 3` (binary `11`), which is the smallest number with two consecutive 1s.

---

### Final Output

```cpp
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

- The result `ans` is printed, which represents the smallest integer that can be formed by rearranging the bits of the original number `n` to have all set bits in consecutive order.

### Summary

This code:
1. Counts the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`.
2. Constructs the smallest integer with that number of set bits in consecutive order by setting the least significant bits in `ans`.
3. Outputs this smallest possible integer.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input: `n = 10`
- Binary of `10` is `1010`, with `count = 2` set bits.
- The loop constructs `ans = 3` (binary `11`), which is the smallest integer with two consecutive set bits.

#### Input: `n = 2`
- Binary of `2` is `10`, with `count = 1` set bit.
- The loop constructs `ans = 1` (binary `1`), which is the smallest integer with one set bit.
