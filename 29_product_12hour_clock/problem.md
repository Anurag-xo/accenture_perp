# Product of two numbers on a 12-hour clock rather than a number line.

- Given two positive integers num1 and num2, the task is to find the product of the two numbers on a 12-hour clock rather than a number line.

- Note: Assume the clock starts from 0 hours to 11 hours.

INPUT1: NUM1 = 3, NUM2 = 7 
OUTPUT1: 9
Explaination: 3 * 7 = 21 . The time in a 12 hour clock is 9.

INPUT1: NUM1 = 3, NUM2 = 4
OUTPUT: 0
