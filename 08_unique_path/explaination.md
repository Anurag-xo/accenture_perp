The code is a solution to find the number of **unique paths** in a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner while avoiding obstacles. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Problem Context**
- **Input**: A 2D grid (`obstacleGrid`) where:
  - `0` represents an open cell.
  - `1` represents an obstacle.
- **Task**: Count the number of unique paths to go from the top-left cell `(0,0)` to the bottom-right cell `(n-1, m-1)`, moving only **down** or **right** at each step. 

---

### **Explanation of the Code**

#### **Step 1: Base Cases**
1. **Empty Grid Check**:  
   ```cpp
   int n = obstacleGrid.size();
   if(n == 0) return 0;
   int m = obstacleGrid[0].size();
   if(m == 0) return 0;
   ```
   If the grid is empty or has no rows/columns, there are no paths, so return `0`.

2. **Check Destination**:  
   ```cpp
   if(obstacleGrid[n-1][m-1]==1) return 0;
   ```
   If the destination cell `(n-1, m-1)` is blocked (value is `1`), no paths are possible, so return `0`.

---

#### **Step 2: Initialize DP Table**
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int> (m, 0));
```
A 2D array `dp` is created to store the number of unique paths from each cell `(i, j)` to the destination `(n-1, m-1)`.

---

#### **Step 3: Iterate Over the Grid**
The algorithm iterates through the grid in reverse (starting from the bottom-right cell) and computes the number of unique paths for each cell.

```cpp
for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    for(int j = m-1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if(obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1) {
```
- It skips cells that are obstacles (`obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`).
- If the cell is open (`obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0`), it calculates the number of paths.

---

#### **Step 4: Compute DP Transitions**
The transitions depend on whether the cell is close to the edges:

1. **Both Down and Right Paths Available**:
   ```cpp
   if(i+1 < n and j+1 < m) {
       dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1];
   }
   ```
   - `dp[i+1][j]`: Number of paths from the cell directly below.
   - `dp[i][j+1]`: Number of paths from the cell directly to the right.

2. **Only Down Path Available**:
   ```cpp
   else if(i+1 < n and j+1 == m) {
       dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j];
   }
   ```
   - Only the cell below is valid.

3. **Only Right Path Available**:
   ```cpp
   else if(j+1 < m and i+1 == n) {
       dp[i][j] = dp[i][j+1];
   }
   ```
   - Only the cell to the right is valid.

4. **Destination Cell**:
   ```cpp
   else {
       dp[i][j] = 1;
   }
   ```
   - If both `i+1 == n` and `j+1 == m`, this cell is the destination itself, so there is exactly **1 path**.

---

#### **Step 5: Return Result**
The value at the top-left cell `dp[0][0]` represents the total number of unique paths from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, m-1)`.

---

### **Algorithm Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times m)\), since every cell of the grid is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times m)\), for the `dp` table.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### Input:
```cpp
obstacleGrid = {
  {0, 0, 0},
  {0, 1, 0},
  {0, 0, 0}
};
```

#### Execution:
1. Initialize:
   ```cpp
   dp = [
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]
   ];
   ```

2. Fill DP Table:
   - Start from `(2,2)` (destination): `dp[2][2] = 1`.
   - Fill remaining cells considering obstacles and paths.

   Final DP Table:
   ```cpp
   dp = [
     [2, 1, 1],
     [1, 0, 1],
     [1, 1, 1]
   ];
   ```

#### Output:
```cpp
return dp[0][0];  // Output is 2
```
There are two paths: `Right → Down → Down → Right` and `Down → Right → Right → Down`.
