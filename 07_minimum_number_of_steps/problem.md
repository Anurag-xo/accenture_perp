# Minimum number of steps

- ALice has to climb N stairs to reach top. In each step Alice can climb either 1 step or M steps.
- Find the minimum number of steps to reach the top.

- Input Format.
1. Input contains Two space seperated integers N and M.

- Output format.
1. Contains integer, that represents minimum number of climbs required to reach top.

- Constraints:
1 <= N = 10^9
1 <= M <= 10^9

- INPUT1: 5 2  OUTPUT1: 3

- Approach
by using Greedy algorithm
