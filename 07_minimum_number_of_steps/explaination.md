This C++ program calculates the total number of "jumps" required to traverse `n` units of distance, given that each jump covers up to `m` units. Here’s a detailed explanation of the code:

---

### **1. Function Definition: `total_jumps`**
```cpp
int total_jumps(int n, int m) {
  return ((n / m) + n % m);
}
```
This function calculates the total number of jumps required.

#### **Parameters**:
- `n`: The total distance to be covered.
- `m`: The maximum distance that can be covered in one jump.

#### **Calculation**:
1. **`n / m`**:
   - This computes the number of full jumps required, where each jump covers exactly `m` units.
   - Example: If `n = 10` and `m = 3`, then `n / m = 3` (3 full jumps covering 9 units).

2. **`n % m`**:
   - This computes the remaining distance after the full jumps.
   - Example: For `n = 10` and `m = 3`, `n % m = 1` (1 unit left to cover).

3. **Sum of Full Jumps and Remainder**:
   - The total jumps are `n / m + n % m`, where:
     - `n / m` gives the count of full jumps.
     - `n % m` adds the remaining distance as a single "partial jump."
   - Example: For `n = 10` and `m = 3`, total jumps = `3 + 1 = 4`.

### **2. Main Function**
#### **Input Reading**:
```cpp
int n;
int m;

cin >> m >> n;
```
- `m` and `n` are read from the user:
  - `m`: Maximum distance per jump.
  - `n`: Total distance to be covered.

#### **Calling the Function**:
```cpp
cout << total_jumps(n, m) << endl;
```
- The `total_jumps` function is called with `n` and `m` as arguments.
- The result, representing the total number of jumps required, is printed.

### **Example Execution**

#### **Input**:
```
3 10
```

#### **Execution**:
1. `n = 10`, `m = 3`
2. Full jumps: `n / m = 10 / 3 = 3`
3. Remaining distance: `n % m = 10 % 3 = 1`
4. Total jumps: `3 + 1 = 4`

#### **Output**:
```
4
```

### **Key Observations**
- The program assumes `m > 0` to avoid division/modulo by zero.
- This implementation is efficient, with constant-time calculations for the total jumps.

### **Code Efficiency**
- Time complexity: **O(1)** (constant time, as there’s no loop or recursion).
- Space complexity: **O(1)** (only a few variables are used). 

This program is compact and solves the problem effectively using basic arithmetic operations.
