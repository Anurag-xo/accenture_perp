# index of the equlibrium point

- Given the function accepts an intger arr of size 'n' as its argument. The function needs to return the index of equilibrium point in the array, where the sum of elements on the left of the index is equal to the sum of elements on the right of the index. If no equilibrium points exists, the function should return -1.

- Input arr: {3, 4, 3, 1, 6}
- Output: 2

Explaination: 3 + 4 = 7 and 1 + 6 = 7 so 3 is the equilibrium point having index 2.
